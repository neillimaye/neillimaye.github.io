### Hello, not much to see here. This is a hub page for the projects I have hosted on Github (and soon other places):
[BetterTempTool](https://neillimaye.github.io/bettertemptool) - A tool for medical marijuana patients to optimize their vaporizer use (Been down for a while as I try to integrate Redux into it)

[StrainJS](https://neillimaye.github.io/strainjs) - A data store schematic for storing information about cannabis strains.
