## Welcome to my Portfolio Hub

### Not much to see here... yet, but take a look:

About me: AE by education, developer by passion.

[BetterTempTool](https://neillimaye.github.io/bettertemptool) - A ReactJS tool for medical marijuana patients to optimize their vaporizer use (Currently integrating Redux into it)

[BetterTempTool-Redux Rewrite](https://neillimaye.github.io/btt-redux/) - BetterTempTool rewritten with Redux for added functionality & expandability. The big new feature is the ability to change the strain being analyzed, a more streamlined file structure, and a data structure to that makes adding different strains way easier.

[Project Strauch](https://github.com/neillimaye/projectstrauch) - Source code only - Annotated Django & React tutorials to make them comprehensible from the source code

[Blockchain Lightbulb](https://github.com/neillimaye/lightbulb-blockchain) - Source code only - A simple React application running on an Ethereum blockchain (powered by ganache) using the Truffle JS library. It updates the ledger every time a button is clicked. Simple functionality.

Unity Game collection  - A collection of games I built from Illinois' CS 199-GAM class 

[Roll A Ball](https://neillimaye.github.io/web_game)

[Roll A Ball V2 - way harder to build](https://neillimaye.github.io/HarderRollV2)

[Space Shooter - surprisingly easier than Roll A Ball V2](https://neillimaye.github.io/SpaceShooter)

[Tanks - Harder than Space Shooter but still easier than Roll A Ball V2](https://neillimaye.github.io/Tanks)
