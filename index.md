## Welcome to my Portfolio Hub

### Not much to see here... yet, but take a look:

About me: [I know very little about CS](http://neillimaye.com/), Programming is a creative outlet for me

[BetterTempTool](https://neillimaye.github.io/bettertemptool) - A ReactJS tool for medical marijuana patients to optimize their vaporizer use (Currently integrating Redux into it)

[Project Strauch](https://github.com/neillimaye/projectstrauch) - Source code only - Annotated Django & React tutorials to make them comprehensible from the source code

[Blockchain Lightbulb](https://github.com/neillimaye/lightbulb-blockchain) - Source code only - A simple React application running on an Ethereum blockchain (powered by ganache) using the Truffle JS library. It updates the ledger every time a button is clicked. Simple functionality.

Unity Game collection - A collection of games I built from Illinois' CS 199-GAM class

[Roll A Ball](https://github.com/neillimaye/web_game)

[Roll A Ball V2 - way harder to build](https://github.com/neillimaye/HarderRollV2)

[Space Shooter - surprisingly easier than Roll A Ball V2](https://github.com/neillimaye/SpaceShooter)
